# Work_Day_Scheduler

Link to deployed application: https://msnow-21.github.io/Work_Day_Scheduler/

Project Overview: The Work Day Scheduler is an application that allows a user to record and save their daily task during normal working hours. When the user opens the application, they are immediately presented with the title of the application and the current date. As the user scrolls down the page, they can see hours from 9am to 5pm listed in rows. In each row there is a text area that allows the user to enter in whatever data they need to help them schedule their day. Pressing the “Lock” image to the right of each text area ensures that the scheduled activity is stored into the browser’s local storage. If the user is worried about losing the content after refreshing the page, the local storage maintains the text content in each of the assigned text areas. If the user has trouble remembering what part of the day has already occurred, the text areas will have background colors to indicate the past hours of the day, the current hour, and upcoming hours.
